## Changelog

- Added a "Legit" mode to FastBreak. Only removes the delay between breaking blocks, without speeding up the breaking process itself. This is slower, but usually bypasses anti-cheat plugins. Use it if regular FastBreak is not working.

- FastBreak will now display its mode/speed in the HackList.

- Improved the reliability of AutoFish.

- Changed the category of AutoSwitch from "Other" to "Items".

- Changed the category of AutoSteal from "Other" to "Items".

- Added a description to AutoSteal's "Delay" setting.

- Pressing the "Steal" and "Store" buttons very quickly will now work as expected.

- Improved the description of Liquids.

- Added a tooltip to sliders saying that you can ctrl-click them for precise input.

- Fixed AutoMine mining more slowly than it should.
